    <description>An alternate site is identified that permits the partial restoration of mission or business essential functions.</description>
    <threat>Environmental disasters, organized disruptions, loss of utilities/services, equipment or system failures, and serious information security incidents are potential events that could disrupt mission or business essential functions.  A recovery strategy should be developed to include an alternate site to mitigate the impact of disruptive events.</threat>
    <implementationGuidance>This general implementation guidance is provided for IAMs/IAOs involved in the creation of a system or organizational  Continuity of Operations (COOP) plan:
 
1. Identify an alternate site that has the capability to at least partially restore mission or business essential functions.
2. Establish a program to ensure comprehensive and effective continuity of essential functions during a broad spectrum of emergencies or situations that may disrupt normal operations (e.g., power failures, damage to facilities caused by storms, fires, flooding, etc.)
3. Ensure that the program includes a strategy to recover and perform partial system operations at the alternate facility for an extended period of time.
4. Partial restoration of mission or business essential functions at an alternate site shall be based on the results of a business impact analyses that identifies and ranks major information systems and mission-critical applications according to their operational priority and the maximum permissible outage for each.
5. Review the system contingency plan to ensure that the alternate site is able to support partial system operations as defined in the plan.
6. The contingency plan shall provide detailed procedures and capabilities to facilitate recovery and sustain functions at the alternate site.
7. The contingency plan shall define a strategy for computing needs to include hardware, software, communication lines, applications, and data. The plan should also include the operators, management, and technical support personnel that will implement the contingency plan.
8. The alternate site shall include HVAC capabilities and any specialized security equipment to sustain partial operations</implementationGuidance>

    <threat>DoD systems processing public information, while not bound by stringent classification or sensitivity concerns, nonetheless require layered defensive mechanisms to prevent malicious actions against system resources.  This protection is achieved by implementing boundary defense mechanisms such as firewalls and IDSes, as well as securely configuring enclave routers, to ensure that access to system resources is confined to authorized users.  While access to public (Internet) resources is permitted, such access must be set up through a demilitarized zone (DMZ), the purpose of which is to isolate network segments with access to public resources.</threat>
    <implementationGuidance>This guidance is designed for IAMs, PMs, SMEs, System Administrators, and all personnel involved in the design and implementation of boundary defense:
 
1. As part of the system design process, identify the specific boundary defense mechanisms to be incorporated into the system security architecture. When making the decision to select specific hardware and software applications for these devices (e.g., firewalls, IDS), refer to the list of devices that have been evaluated by the NIAP program under Common Criteria and meet the fundamental requirements outlined in NSTISSP 1.  This list is available online at:  http://niap.nist.gov/cc-scheme/vpl/vpl_type.html.
2. Review the NIAP evaluation summary for each product, focusing on the Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) for each product. For information systems processing public information, a minimum evaluation level of EAL-3 is required.
3. Once boundary defense mechanisms for the system have been identified, ensure that each mechanism is incorporated into a system security architecture documentation that details physical and logical placement of the mechanism within the system, data flows, ports, protocols, and services used; and interconnections between related systems or network segments.
4. Ensure that all boundary defense devices for public systems (i.e., firewalls, IDS, and boundary routers) are configured in accordance with approved DoD secure configuration standards, preferably the most current DISA STIGs for each specific mechanism.  If STIGs are unavailable for specific mechanisms,  refer to other approved DoD guidance such as NSA configuration guidelines, DoD guidelines created by and adopted from other organizations, or the vendor’s own configuration guidance.
5. Ensure that access lists and rule bases for boundary routers and firewalls for the classified system are configured such that access to or from any network segment or node to the public Internet must is done only from a DMZ.
6. Ensure that boundary defense mechanisms adhere to the DoD ports, protocols, and services implementation process.
7. Ensure that wireless networks terminate in DMZs and are segregated from back office LAN traffic unless they pass through a secure gateway or VLAN.</implementationGuidance>

    <description>Boundary defense mechanisms, to include firewalls and network intrusion detection systems (IDS) are deployed at the enclave boundary to the wide area network, at layered or internal enclave boundaries, or at key points in the network, as required.  All Internet access is proxied through Internet access points that are under the management and control of the enclave and are isolated from other DoD information systems by physical or technical means.</description>
    <threat>Systems processing sensitive information require layered defensive mechanisms to control access to the information from outside the enclave, as well as prevent inadvertent disclosure  by allowing connections to untrusted public (Internet) resources.  This protection is achieved by implementing boundary defense mechanisms such as firewalls and IDSes, as well as securely configuring enclave routers, to ensure that access to sensitive information is restricted to authorized users and trusted sources.  Additionally, uncontrolled access to public (Internet) resources by a system processing sensitive information elevates the risk of inadvertent disclosure through unauthorized access.  For this reason access to external (Internet) systems is proxied to ensure that connections are made to trusted sources only.</threat>

    <threat>Systems processing classified information require layered defensive mechanisms to control access to the information from outside the enclave, as well as prevent inadvertent disclosure  by allowing connections to the public Internet.  This protection is achieved by implementing boundary defense mechanisms such as firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), as well as securely configuring enclave routers, to ensure that access to classified information is restricted to authorized users and trusted sources.  Access to the public Internet from a classified system enclave would result in almost certain compromise of classified data.  For this reason access to external (Internet) systems is prohibited by the boundary defense mechanisms.</threat>

3. Once boundary defense mechanisms for the system have been identified, ensure that each mechanism is incorporated into a system security architecture documentation that details physical and logical placement of the mechanism within the system, data flows, ports, protocols, and services used; and interconnections between related systems or network segments.

6. Ensure that boundary defense mechanisms adhere to the DoD ports, protocols, and services implementation process.
7. Ensure that enclave boundary defenses include the following:
  - Capability to monitor higher layer protocols (commonly called “deep-content scans”).
  - Active monitoring of event logs on a continual basis and prompt response to threats.</implementationGuidance>

    <description>All remote access to DoD information systems, to include telework access, is mediated through a managed access control point, such as a remote access server in a DMZ. Remote access always uses encryption to protect the confidentiality of the session. The session-level encryption equals or exceeds the robustness established in ECCT. Authenticators are restricted to those that offer strong protection against spoofing. Information regarding remote access mechanisms (e.g., Internet address, dial-up connection telephone number) is protected.</description>
    <threat>Remote access allows users to interact with enclave resources from afar.  This convenience introduces inherent risks such as spoofing and brute force attacks.  Proper security precautions such as a properly configured remote access server in a DMZ along with approved encryption techniques minimize the chance of network compromise and attack.</threat>
    <implementationGuidance>1. All remote access connections shall authentic network users and encrypt transmitted data by using approved access controls and cryptographic means.

    <description>To help prevent inadvertent disclosure of controlled information, all contractors are identified by the inclusion of the abbreviation "ctr" and all foreign nationals are identified by the inclusion of their two character country code in: - DoD user e-mail addresses (e.g., john.smith.ctr@army.mil orjohn.smith.uk@army.mil); - DoD user e-mail display names (e.g., John Smith, Contractor &lt;john.smith.ctr@army.mil&gt; or John Smith, United Kingdom &lt;john.smith.uk@army.mil&gt;); and - automated signature blocks (e.g., John Smith, Contractor, J-6K, Joint Staff or John Doe, Australia, LNO, Combatant Command). Contractors who are also foreign nationals are identified as both (e.g.,john.smith.ctr.uk@army.mil). Country codes and guidance regarding their use are in FIPS 10-4.</description>
    <threat>Classified and sensitive information could be disclosed to unauthorized users who do not have proper security clearances and need to know.  Proper assignment of user accounts and email addresses will protect classified and sensitive information from unauthorized disclosure, modification, or destruction.  This implementation guide is aimed to help system and network managers/administrators implement consistent assignment and maintenance of user profile.</threat>
    <implementationGuidance>1. Once a user submits a DOD standard or agency’s Access Request Form upon approval of the user’s manager/supervisor, the system/network administrator shall review the user information and determine if the user is a contractor or a foreign national.
2. If the user is a contractor, the system/network administrator, when creating the new user account, shall assign the abbreviation “CTR” to his/her email address (e.g.,john.smith.CTR@army.mil). Configure the email server to display the email address on the screen, such as John Smith, Contractor john.smith.ctr@army.mil
3. If the user is a foreign national, review the country code identified in FIPS 10-4 and include their two character country code in (e.g.,john.smith.uk@army.mil) and configure the email server to display the email address on the screen as John Smith, United Kingdom john.smith.uk@army.mil
4. If the user is both contractor and foreign national, include both information (e.g.,john.smith.ctr.uk@army.mil).
5. The network administrator shall assign names for the automated signature block to include contractor or country name as follows: John Smith, Contractor, J-6K, Joint Staff or John Doe, Australia, LNO, Combatant Command.
6. The network administrator shall test the proper display of the email addresses by sending an initial email to the new user and verify if the email address is shown as described above.</implementationGuidance>

    <description>Access to all DoD information (classified, sensitive, and public) is determined by both its classification and user need-to-know. Need-to-know is established by the Information Owner and enforced by discretionary or role-based access controls. Access controls are established and enforced for all shared or networked file systems and internal websites, whether classified, sensitive, or unclassified. All internal classified, sensitive, and unclassified websites are organized to provide at least three distinct levels of access:
1. Open access to general information that is made available to all DoD authorized users with network access. Access does not require an audit transaction.
2. Controlled access to information that is made available to all DoD authorized users upon the presentation of an individual authenticator. Access is recorded in an audit transaction.</description>
    <threat>Unauthorized access could be made to classified and sensitive information that must be protected from unauthorized disclosure, modification, or destruction.  This implementation guide is aimed to help web administrators/network administrators implement proper discretionary or role based access controls, as well as user authenticators and audit trails to prevent and detect unauthorized access to system data effectively.</threat>
    <implementationGuidance>1.   For the system that provides public information without restrictions, the web administrator shall implement the following for the external web server:
  a. Implement an external router between the external web server and the Internet to filter the traffic to the external web server.
  b. Configure the web server in accordance with the DISA Web Server STIG
  c. Configure the web server operating system in accordance with proper DISA STIGs (e.g., Windows, Unix)
  d. Provide only Read access to Public
  e. Disable the public access auditing feature to prevent system crash
  f. Restrict access to a limited number of people for web content management
2. For the system that provides classified and/or sensitive information to all DOD authorized users with network access, the web administrator shall implement the following for the internal web server:
  a. Implement internal firewalls, routers, and switches in accordance with DOD SIPRNET and NIPRNET Connection Approval Process
  b. Configure the internal web server in accordance with DISA Web Server STIG
  c. Configure the web server operating system (e.g., Windows, Unix) in accordance with proper DISA STIGs, which require DOD approved user ID and authenticators (e.g., password, token) prior to system access
  d. Configure the database containing classified and sensitive information made available to all DOD users in accordance with DISA Database STIG for role based access controls in the areas of table and column privileges and file permissions
  e. Configure the web application properly to prevent any direct access of users to the database
  f. Configure the audit features of the system components (e.g., operating system, database, and application) to capture security related activities (e.g., logon/logoff)
  g. Maintain and update a list of user accounts regularly to prevent unauthorized access
3. For the system that is available only to an authorized community of interest, the system/network administrator shall implement the following:
  a. Configure the system server operating system in accordance with proper DISA STIGs (e.g., Windows, Unix) or NSA security guides
  b. Assign user accounts and authenticators based on need to know in accordance with DOD and organization’s security policies

    <description>Access procedures enforce the principles of separation of duties and "least privilege."  Access to privileged accounts is limited to privileged users. Use of privileged accounts is limited to privileged functions; that is, privileged users use non-privileged accounts for all non-privileged functions. This control is in addition to an appropriate security clearance and need-to-know authorization.</description>
    <threat>Unauthorized users could gain access to critical classified and/or sensitive data through the improperly granted privileges.  This could result in unauthorized disclosure, modification, and destruction of classified and sensitive information.  This implementation guide is aimed to help system administrators implement proper access privileges based on user job functions and need to know and maintain privileged accounts securely.</threat>
    <implementationGuidance>1. The Information Assurance Manager (IAM) shall determine the number of roles/groups that are associated with specific functions required for the system.
2. The IAM shall determine the names of the specific roles/groups (e.g., Engineering, IA, Configuration Management) and assign users to specific groups based on user’s job functions.
3. The system administrator shall grant least privileges to individual users within the group (e.g., read, write, execute) only based on user job functions and need to know and upon the completion of background investigation.
4. The system administrator shall grant access to privileged accounts (e.g., root, administrator) only to a limited number of privileged users (e.g., system administrator, database administrator, application administrator).
5. The system administrator shall assign individual unique user accounts (e.g., johndoe1) to users with privileged functions, which must be used only to perform non-privileged functions.
6. The system administrator shall review audit trails regularly to ensure that privileged users use the non-privileged accounts to perform non-privileged functions.
7. The system administrator shall create non-privileged accounts for privileged users to perform non-privileged functions.</implementationGuidance>

    <threat>An organization’s network and the integrity of stored information are at risk if the control of actions, functions, applications and operations of legitimate users are not managed with a role-based access scheme.  The unnecessary allocation and use of system privileges significantly increases the vulnerability of systems.  Role-based systems are designed to minimize the potential for inside security violations by providing greater control over users' access to information and resources.  Also, by assigning individuals to predefined roles, the administrative process of establishing privileges is streamlined and management time for reviewing privilege assignments is reduced.</threat>

2. Systems shall employ a role-based access scheme that enforces separation of duties and network privileges.
3. Privileged user accounts (administrators, root/super users on UNIX, routers and LAN servers, SANs, etc) shall be limited to the absolute minimum number needed to manage the system, and the IAM shall document all privileged role assignments.
4. Privileged user accounts shall be limited to the minimum number of privileges needed to perform their assigned duties.
5. Where technically possible, privileged users should initially log on with a personal user ID and only be granted privileged access by way of group assignment.
6. Privileged and guest accounts shall be renamed from any default.</implementationGuidance>

    <description>All authorizations to the information contained within an object are revoked prior to initial assignment, allocation, or reallocation to a subject from the system's pool of unused objects. No information, including encrypted representations of information, produced by a prior subject's actions is available to any subject that obtains access to an object that has been released back to the system. There is absolutely no residual data from the former object.</description>
    <threat>The constant reallocation of objects is a security risk because residual data may remain when the object is reassigned to a new process after a previous process is finished with it.  Clearing residual data from an object before reuse assures that system resources, in particular storage media, are allocated and reassigned among system users in a manner which prevents the disclosure of sensitive information.</threat>
    <implementationGuidance>1. If a system component is required to make policy enforcement decisions or implement a security feature, it is considered to be an Information Assurance (IA) enabled IT component, and it must be validated to ensure that residual data is cleared before any object reuse.  Operating systems and firewalls are examples of IA enabled components.
2. COTS or GOTS IA and IA enabled products shall be evaluated and validated in accordance with: The International Common Criteria for Information Security Technology Evaluation Mutual Recognition Arrangement; The National Security Agency (NSA) /National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) Evaluation and Validation Program; or The NIST Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) validation program.
3. A validated products list can be found at the http://www.niap-ccevs.org/ website along with procedures to get a product through the validation process.</implementationGuidance>

    <threat>The amount of information in audit logs can be very large and extremely difficult to analyze manually; important security related events could be overlooked.  Audit review tools are available that can query the audit records by user ID, date/time, or some other set of parameters to run reports of selected information.</threat>
    <implementationGuidance>1. Determine if an audit reduction capability exists. This capability can be either OS provided or an add-on product.
2. Operating systems and applications shall have the capability to review audit records and generate reports from the audit records. Most operating systems and applications have built-in auditing capabilities, but if they don’t, a DOD approved auditing utility shall be acquired. Selection of the individual approved software should be determined by auditing capabilities, ease of use, administrative overhead, and system overhead, as well as enterprise or organizational policy on auditing requirements.
3. Operating systems typically provide at least the minimum tools and utilities to review audit records and generate reports. Microsoft Windows event viewer tracks all security events and can selectively review audit records, and the Solaris operating system uses the ‘praudit’ utility for audit reviews.</implementationGuidance>

    <implementationGuidance>1. Activate audit logging for security-significant components and systems.
2. Limit access to audit data to authorized system administrators.
3. Set system controls to ensure that audit logs that have reached maximum length are not overwritten. If possible, the system should issue a warning that log data length is approaching the maximum value and then should fail gracefully.
4. Ensure that procedures exist for moving audit trails from on-line to archival media.
5. Inspection and modification of audit data are, themselves, security significant events that should generate log entries.</implementationGuidance>

    <description>Wireless computing and networking capabilities from workstations, laptops, personal digital assistants (PDAs), handheld computers, cellular phones, or other portable electronic devices are implemented in accordance with DoD wireless policy, as issued. (See also ECCT). Unused wireless computing capabilities internally embedded in interconnected DoD IT assets are normally disabled by changing factory defaults, settings or configurations prior to issue to end users. Wireless computing and networking capabilities are not independently configured by end users.</description>
    <threat>Wireless computing and networking provide many benefits such as portability and flexibility, increased productivity, and lower installation costs.  However, wireless networks present similar security risks to those of a wired network, and since the open airwaves are the communications medium for wireless technology, an entirely new set of risks are introduced.  Implementing wireless computing and networking capabilities in accordance with DoD wireless policy and allowing only authorized and qualified personnel to configure wireless services greatly reduces vulnerabilities.</threat>
    <implementationGuidance>1. All wireless systems shall be approved by the DAA prior to installation and use for processing DoD information.
2. Personally owned wireless devices shall not be used for processing DoD information.
3. A list of all DAA approved WLAN devices shall be maintained.
4. All individual functions of multi-functional devices shall be secured.
5. Wireless devices shall be documented in the system security documentation.
6. All wireless devices, particularly laptops, shall comply with applicable operating system STIGs.
7. DoD approved anti-virus software shall be installed and configured in accordance with the Desktop Application STIG on all wireless devices, particularly laptops and PDAs, and kept up-to-date with the most recent virus definition tables.</implementationGuidance>

    <description>A comprehensive account management process is implemented to ensure that only authorized users can gain access to workstations, applications, and networks and that individual accounts designated as inactive, suspended, or terminated are promptly deactivated.</description>
    <threat>Information within the organization is potentially vulnerable to access and exploitation by individuals using active accounts that should have been deactivated.  This includes individuals who have transferred from the organization, had their employment terminated, lost appropriate security clearance/need-to-know, or who otherwise are no longer authorized access to the system or its information resources.  In order to prevent unauthorized access and potential loss/compromise/destruction of information, it is essential that accounts be properly controlled and restricted only to authorized users.</threat>
    <implementationGuidance>This implementation guidance is designed for use by Information Assurance Managers and/or System Administrators.  The following general implementation guidelines apply:
 
1. During the operating system installation process on servers and workstations, ensure that default accounts and associated passwords are disabled and/or removed IAW procedures applicable to the specific system (see the appropriate DISA STIG or vendor documentation).
2. During the application installation process on servers and workstations, ensure that any default accounts and associated passwords associated with the applications are disabled and/or removed IAW procedures applicable to the specific system (see the appropriate DISA STIG or vendor documentation).
3. When creating a new account for a system user, the registration process should collect at a minimum the following user information:
  - Name
  - Title and Position
  - IT Category
  - Organization
  - Phone Number
  - Official email address
  - Supervisor’s Name and Contact Information
  - Security Clearance Level/Special Access information
  - Projected Transfer Date (for military or TDY personnel)
4. Ensure that users and/or supervisors are aware of the requirement to notify System Administrators and IAMs/IAOs immediately when users no longer require or are authorized system access.
5. Disable and remove user IDs and passwords within two days of notification that a user no longer requires or is authorized system access.
6. System Administrators shall suspend user accounts that have been inactive for 30 days or more.
7. System Administrators shall immediately disable any account through which unauthorized user activity has been detected.</implementationGuidance>

    <implementationGuidance>1. The system administrator and project manager shall determine if it is necessary to assign group accounts to support system operations and mission.
2. Once it is determined that group accounts are required to support system maintenance and operations and/or network access, the system administrator and the project manager shall determine if group authenticators can be used based on the DOD PKI.
3. If the DOD PKI can be used, the system administrator shall coordinate with the DOD PKI Program Office for use of group accounts.
4. If the DOD PKI cannot be used, the project manager submits a request for an approval to DAA and obtains an approval from DAA.
5. For the group accounts to support application maintenance and functions or network access, the system and network administrators shall perform the following:
  - Identify individual groups that require group accounts
  - Identify users for each group, maintain the list of users, and update the list
  - Determine the group accounts depending on group functions
  - Assign individual group accounts and a unique password for individual groups
  - Distribute the passwords to the users securely</implementationGuidance>

    <description>DoD information system access is gained through the presentation of an individual identifier (e.g., a unique token or user login ID) and password. For systems utilizing a logon ID as the individual identifier, passwords are, at a minimum, a case sensitive 8-character mix of upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, and special characters, including at least one of each (e.g., emPagd2!). At least four characters must be changed when a new password is created. Deployed/tactical systems with limited data input capabilities implement the password to the extent possible.
Registration to receive a user ID and password includes authorization by a supervisor, and is done in person before a designated registration authority. Additionally, to the extent system capabilities permit, system mechanisms are implemented to enforce automatic expiration of passwords and to prevent password reuse. All factory set, default or standard-user IDs and passwords are removed or changed. Authenticators
are protected commensurate with the classification or sensitivity of the information accessed; they are not shared; and they are not embedded in access scripts or stored on function keys. Passwords are encrypted both for storage and for transmission.</description>
    <threat>Access to DoD information sytems must be protected commensurate with the sensitivity of the information the systems process.  For this reason it is mandatory that each individual who is authorized access to DoD information systems be provided with a unique individual identifier in the form of either a DoD PKI certificate, CAC card, or username and password.  Failure to require an individual I&amp;A mechanism leaves DoD information resources vulnerable to theft, exploitation, unauthorized modification, or destruction.</threat>
    <implementationGuidance>This implementation guidance is designed for use by Information Assurance Managers, System Administrators, or individual Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) tasked with implementation of I&amp;A mechanisms.  The following general implementation guidelines apply:
 
1. To ensure compliance with (DoD PKI policy), DoD PKI is to be the primary mechanism of individual identification and authentication for all DoD systems wherever possible. For DoD PKI infrastructure implementation guidance, refer to DoDI 8520.2, Enclosure 3 (01 Apr 04).
2. For systems that have not yet implemented, or are unable to implement DoD PKI, ensure that individual user accounts are set up in accordance with guidance provided in implementation guidance for IAAC-1 and ECLP-1.
3. When setting up user accounts on workstations, servers, databases, or individual applications, system administrators shall set password configuration parameters to ensure that password structure conforms to the following standards:
  - Passwords must be a minimum of eight (8) characters in length.
  - Passwords must contain a case-sensitive mixture of letters, digits, and special characters (e.g., punctuation marks, etc.) such as the example (emPagd2!).      -  Whenever a password is changed (by the user or system administrator), at least four characters must be changed from the previous password (e.g., [emPagd2!] becomes [0LP&amp;gd2?]).
  - Password aging must be enabled to ensure that passwords must be changed at least every ninety (90) days for classified and SBU systems and no more frequently than every seven (7) days for both types of system.
  - System administrators shall configure system accounts to maintain a password history for a period of at least one (1) year. Additionally, users shall not be allowed to use any of their ten (10) previously used passwords.
4. Ensure that the process for registering new users on the system and providing user ID and password conform to practices outlined in IAAC-1.
5. System Administrators (or other SMEs involved in Independent Verification and Validation of password features) shall test the robustness of user passwords on systems processing classified or SBU information by employing a DoD-approved password policy enforcement tool (e.g., Anixis PPE).
6. System Administrators are to ensure that all default, factory-set, or standard-user accounts and associated default passwords are disabled and, to the extent that the OS or application permits, removed completely. Refer to OS, system, or application-specific STIGs, configuration standards, or vendor’s configuration guidance for specific steps on how do disable and/or remove default user accounts, IDs, and passwords.
7. Authenticators/user IDs/passwords shall be protected in the following manner:
  - Access to system files containing user account information and passwords shall be restricted to system administrators
  - Files containing authenticator information shall be classified at the level of information for which the accounts and passwords are assigned to protect.
  - Passwords shall be shadowed. If password characters display in clear text while being entered into the password acceptance field, check the configuration of the application to ensure that the shadowing feature is enabled.
  - System security policy, rules of behavior, or other applicable system user policy shall be written in a manner that specifically prohibits the sharing of passwords among users.
  - Review any and all scripts used for automated boot processes or application access shall be reviewed to ensure that they contain no password automation or access features.
8. User passwords shall be encrypted, both at rest and in transit through the network using robust (i.e., 128-bit or stronger) encryption through a DoD-approved algorithm (e.g., RC4, RC5, IDEA, Blowfish) and through such robust means of secure transit as SSH and SSL-3.</implementationGuidance>

All symmetric keys used to encrypted data must be protected commensurate with the classification level of the information being protected.  For Asymmetric keys the user or custodian must protect the private key commensurate with the classification level of the information being protected.  The processes for creating and distributing keys used to encrypt transmit classified information and to authenticate users who are authorized access to classified information must be carried out using highly secure processes.  The DoD Public Key Infrastructure can be utilized to encrypt data on Classified networks, Classified data transmitted across untrusted networks must be encrypted using.  The security requirements for cryptographic key management encompass the entire lifecycle of cryptographic keys, cryptographic key components, and Cryptographic Service Providers employed by the cryptographic module.  Key management includes random number and key generation, key establishment, key distribution, key entry/output, key storage, and key zeroization.</threat>
    <implementationGuidance>1. The PKI manages the registration, issuance and control of X.509 certificates for use by DoD personnel in the conduct of official business.  An X.509 certificate binds an end entity (such as a subscriber, router, or automated message guard) to a key pair, certifying that the entity identified in the certificate has the private key associated with the public key incorporated into the certificate.
2. The key pairs are used by end entities to perform cryptographic operations: to digitally sign information, to ensure the identity of the signer and the integrity of the information, and to encrypt information to ensure confidentiality. The DoD PKI issues separate certificates and key pairs for identity authentication and integrity, and for confidentiality.
3. Secret keys, private keys, and Cryptographic Service Providers shall be protected within the cryptographic module from unauthorized disclosure, modification, and substitution. Public keys shall be protected within the cryptographic module against unauthorized modification and substitution. 
4. SAs shall document and specify all cryptographic keys, cryptographic key components, and Cryptographic Service Providers employed by a cryptographic module.
5. All private key pairs that are used to assert non-repudiation and are tightly bound to an entities identity must be protected in accordance with classification level of the information being processed.
6. All users and custodians are responsible to protect and store all private keys. For the hardware token, users must promptly report lost or stolen tokens. For software private keys, users must store them in a tamper evident package locked in a safe.</implementationGuidance>

    <description>A comprehensive vulnerability management process that includes the systematic identification and mitigation of software and hardware vulnerabilities is in place. Wherever system capabilities permit, mitigation is independently validated through inspection and automated vulnerability assessment or state management tools.  Vulnerability assessment tools have been acquired, personnel have been appropriately trained, procedures have been developed, and regular internal and external assessments are conducted. For improved interoperability, preference is given to tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to test for the presence of vulnerabilities.</description>
    <threat>1. Newly identified vulnerabilities in operating system and application software.
2. Software received from vendor and installed without service packs and patches (new and re-built systems).
3. Software no longer supported by vendor.
4. Loss of configuration and change management (CCM) discipline.
5. Loss of Certification and Accreditation integrity.</threat>
